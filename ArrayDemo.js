/*  Slice v/s Splice
ðŸ”¹ slice()
=> Definition: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.
   Does NOT change (mutate) the original array.

ðŸ”¹ splice()
=> Definition: Changes (mutates) the original array by adding/removing elements.

Example :- 

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "orange", "grapes"];
let removed = fruits.splice(2, 2);
console.log(removed); // ["mango", "orange"]
console.log(fruits);  // ["apple", "banana", "grapes"] (modified)
